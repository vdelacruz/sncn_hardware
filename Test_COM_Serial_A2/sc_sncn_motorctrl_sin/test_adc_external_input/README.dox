\section test_adc_external_input

This test application illustrates usage of module_adc to get external analog sensor
input values. By default all analog inputs are configured as differential only.

The main application need to run only two threads and one of them is ADC Server 
(adc_ad7949) and other is ADC Client thread, but if the user needs motor control 
application to run we have a bunch of thread for motor drive/control along with 
a different ADC Server (adc_ad7949_triggered) and same ADC Client thread. ADC server 
thread runs on CORE 3 which has physical connection to the interface module (IFM) 
having General purpose Analog input ports.

Another thread for client functions is running on CORE 1 (can also be placed on 
CORE 0/2 but not on core 3 since the client function thread has prints which will 
slow ADC Server thread). The client reads analog input from ADC Server and prints 
them. The client function also shows how to make use of XSCOPE to probe/store data 
in real-time.
