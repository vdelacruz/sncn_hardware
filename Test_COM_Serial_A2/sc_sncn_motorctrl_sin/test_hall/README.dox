This test application illustrates usage of module_hall to get position and velocity
informartion

The main application has two threads and one of them is Hall server thread running 
on CORE 3 which has physical connection to the interface module (IFM) to which the 
Hall Sensors are connected. 

Another thread for client functions is running on CORE 1 (can also be placed on 
CORE 0/2 but not on core 3 since the client function thread has prints which will 
slow the Hall Server thread). The client reads position and velocity from HALL Server.
 The client function also shows how to make use of XSCOPE to probe/store data in real-time.

More information about Hall Server/ Client can be found in module_hall Readme

Dependencies: sc_somanet-base/module_nodeconfig, module_hall, module_blocks, module_common
