\section test_gpio_digital

This test application illustrates usage of module_gpio to configure GPIO's and 
read/write the digital ports.

The main application runs two threads and one of them is GPIO Digital server thread 
running on CORE 3 which has physical connection to the interface module (IFM) having 
GPIO ports 

Another thread for client functions is running on CORE 1 (can also be placed on 
CORE 0/2 but not on core 3 since the client function thread has prints which will 
slow the GPIO Server thread). The Client function configures port 0 and port 1 as 
input switches and remaining 2 ports as outputs and shows how to read/write the 
digital ports. The client function also shows how to make use of XSCOPE to probe/store 
port data in real-time.

More information about GPIO Server/ Client can be found in module_gpio Readme

Dependencies: sc_somanet-base/module_nodeconfig, module_gpio, module_common
