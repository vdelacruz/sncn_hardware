Test illustrates usage of module_qei to get position and calculate velocity information

The main application runs two threads and one of them is QEI server thread running 
on CORE 3 which has physical connection to the interface module (IFM) to which the 
QEI Sensors are connected. 

Another thread for client functions is running on CORE 1 (it can also be placed on 
CORE 0/2 but not on core 3 since the client function thread has prints which will 
slow the QEI Server thread). The client reads position fron QEI Server and calculates 
velocity from the position info. The client function also shows how to make use of
XSCOPE to probe/store data in real-time (velocity info is only accurate while 
using xscope).


More information about QEI Server/ Client can be found under module_qei Readme

Dependencies: sc_somanet-base/module_nodeconfig, module_qei, module_blocks, 
module_common
